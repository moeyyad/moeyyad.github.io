## Elucidate

_"Learn to negotiate like a pro by playing mock negotiation games against AI"_

Elucidate is a learning platform that helps users develop valuable communications skills (like public speaking or negotiation) through a practice-centered approach.

**The problem we are trying to solve:** Developing strong communication skills are incredibly important to the lives and careers of so many people, and yet, it is so difficult to do.

We aren't launched yet. MVP is coming soon.
