## The Fundemental Problem of Small Business

Small businesses due to their nature of being "small" don't have the same level of resources traditionally available to big businesses. Many of them don't have a sales team, a marketing team, or employees dedicated solely to customer support. Instead, the business owner and a small team of essential staff handle these as peripheral tasks to offering their core service or product. This seems obvious, so obvious that it doesn't register as a _problem_ but as a _fact_.

The result is that small businesses have a hard time growing outside of the slow natural growth that word-of-mouth provides when you make customers happy.

We believe that AI can drastically change what small businesses are capable of by giving them powerful and cost-effective tools that can let them rival big businesses in their local area. This is why we are building SendAll: an email marketing tool that accelerates growth just as fast a sales team.

SendAll helps you reach businesses and organizations around you that are specifically relevant to your own business in just a few minutes. Essentially, we help local businesses build better relationships with their local community.

Our MVP is coming soon and we are excited about the journey ahead.
