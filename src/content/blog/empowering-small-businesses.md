description: "Small businesses have a lot to gain from AI tools"
---

Small businesses due to their nature of being "small" don't have the same level of resources traditionally available to big businesses. Many of them don't have a sales team, marketing team, business intelligence analysts, the list goes on. Instead, the business owner and a small team of essential staff handle these functions as peripheral tasks to offering their core service or product. This seems obvious, so obvious that it doesn't register as a _problem_ but as a _fact_.

The result is that small businesses have a hard time growing beyond the slow natural growth that word-of-mouth provides when you make customers happy.

I believe that AI can drastically change what small businesses are capable of by giving them powerful and cost-effective tools that can let them rival big businesses in their local area.

Currently I'm building one such tool: an AI email marketing assistant that automatically reaches out to the businesses and organizations around you that are specifically relevant to your own business. Essentially, this tool helps local businesses build better relationships with their local community, and hopefully thrive as a result.

I'm testing out this idea for Saint Joseph, and if it works well, I can spin it into a startup.
